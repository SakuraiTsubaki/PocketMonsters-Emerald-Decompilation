# Milestones: Pokemon Emerald / Pocket Monsters Emerald

This roadmap governs research, tooling, analysis, reconstruction, and preservation for `SakuraiTsubaki/PocketMonsters-Emerald-Decompilation`.

## Ground rules

- Milestones are evidence gates, not date promises or percentages.
- Complete them in dependency order unless an independent experiment is clearly labeled.
- Original, modified, and rebuilt ROM or complete game-package binaries remain local and are never committed.
- Commit every other storable work product: notes, references, source, scripts, tools, settings, logs, manifests, tables, CSV/JSON/YAML, patches, validation evidence, and generated outputs.
- Graphics and sprite work must include actual viewable PNG results alongside encoded data and metadata.
- Diagnostics, validation, and safe failure handling remain ordinary engineering responsibilities.
- A milestone becomes complete only when its exit criteria are backed by committed evidence.

## Target snapshot

| Field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Target | Pokemon Emerald / Pocket Monsters Emerald |
| Platform family | Game Boy Advance |
| Generation | Generation III |
| Identity status | `selected-multi-variant` |

The current identity status is `selected-multi-variant`. Existing claims remain provisional for milestone purposes until their manifests and reproduction commands satisfy the exit criteria.

## Dependency chain

`T0 → T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → T5 → T6`

Parallel work is allowed inside a milestone, but later results must cite the exact earlier manifests and tool versions they depend on.

## T0 — Scope and exact target identity

**Goal:** establish the precise legal research target and a reproducible input contract.

**Required outputs**

- Complete `config/target.json` with release, region/language, revision or version, edition/update context, and cryptographic hashes.
- Provenance notes that identify how local inputs were obtained without committing protected game images or secrets.
- A deterministic identity verifier and fixture-based tests.
- A target-selection decision record listing rejected or still-unknown candidates.
- A machine-readable matrix when more than one variant is intentionally in scope.

**Exit criteria**

- A fresh authorized local input can be accepted or rejected deterministically.
- Every scope claim is either supported by evidence or explicitly marked unknown.
- CI validates the target schema without requiring ROM bytes.

## T1 — Reproducible structural inventory

**Goal:** produce a deterministic, reviewable map of the target before interpretation.

**Required outputs**

- GBA header and checksum report; ROM-region inventory; ARM/Thumb entry-point map; memory-map and pointer-range tables; compression and archive candidate catalog.
- Stable CSV/JSON manifests containing offsets, sizes, hashes, hierarchy, and tool versions where applicable.
- Extraction commands, environment notes, logs, and repeat-run comparison results.
- Sanitized synthetic fixtures covering parser boundaries and malformed-input handling.

**Exit criteria**

- Two clean runs on the same identified input produce identical manifests.
- Every extracted or indexed item has traceable source coordinates.
- Tools fail safely and explain unsupported structures without silently guessing.

## T2 — Executable and symbol map

**Goal:** turn executable regions into a navigable evidence-backed code map.

**Required outputs**

- Verified ARM/Thumb boundaries, functions, call edges, literal pools, data references, compiler fingerprints, symbols, and confidence records.
- Machine-readable function, section, relocation, symbol, and reference tables.
- Naming conventions that distinguish confirmed, probable, and hypothetical symbols.
- Reproducible disassembly/decompilation commands and representative annotated slices.
- Comparison tables for every intentionally supported variant.

**Exit criteria**

- Entry points and major execution regions are accounted for.
- Every promoted symbol cites address/range evidence and confidence.
- Generated maps are deterministic and consumable by later reconstruction tools.

## T3 — Resource formats and asset pipelines

**Goal:** document and reproduce the target's non-code data formats.

**Required outputs**

- Text, scripts, maps, graphics, sprites, tiles, palettes, fonts, audio, and tables with converters, schemas, manifests, and PNG previews for visual assets.
- Round-trip or semantic-equivalence tests for each supported converter.
- Source-coordinate and hash manifests for converted results.
- PNG sheets, previews, or comparisons for graphics, sprites, icons, fonts, palettes, tiles, textures, and other visual work.
- Format specifications separating verified fields from unresolved bytes.

**Exit criteria**

- Each claimed format has at least one reproducible fixture and documented command.
- Converted outputs retain provenance and can be regenerated deterministically.
- Visual pipelines include reviewable PNG output, not only metadata.

## T4 — Reviewed reconstruction slices

**Goal:** reconstruct bounded components with clear evidence and interfaces.

**Required outputs**

- Small, reviewable source or data slices linked to original coordinates and manifests.
- Buildable or testable boundaries, interface notes, assumptions, and confidence records.
- Equivalence checks appropriate to the component: bytes, layout, decoded data, control flow, state transitions, or observable behavior.
- Generated files, maps, logs, and comparison reports needed to audit each slice.

**Exit criteria**

- Every slice can be regenerated and validated without committing a ROM.
- Reviewers can trace each conclusion from input identity through tooling to output.
- Unknown behavior remains explicitly marked instead of being filled by invention.

## T5 — Integrated reproducible workflow

**Goal:** connect identity, extraction, analysis, conversion, reconstruction, and validation into one documented workflow.

**Required outputs**

- A clean-environment bootstrap and ordered command manifest.
- Version-pinned tool configuration and deterministic output locations.
- Cross-component integration tests and representative end-to-end fixtures.
- Coverage/gap reports for code regions, resource families, variants, and unsupported cases.
- Build or reassembly instructions that consume a user-supplied local input when required and never publish a complete game image.

**Exit criteria**

- A new contributor can reproduce documented non-ROM outputs from the declared inputs and commands.
- CI verifies all repository-owned tooling and fixtures.
- Generated differences are explained by a checked-in report or treated as a failed validation.

## T6 — Evidence-backed research release

**Goal:** publish a coherent, reusable research release without overstating completeness.

**Required outputs**

- Versioned documentation, schemas, tools, source, data, manifests, and generated non-ROM artifacts.
- A release manifest listing exact commits, tool versions, supported identities, coverage, and known unknowns.
- Archived logs and validation summaries sufficient to audit the release.
- Migration notes for schema/tool changes and a backlog for the next evidence cycle.

**Exit criteria**

- All included claims have confidence labels and inspectable evidence.
- The release contains no ROM or equivalent complete game-package binary, credentials, keys, or machine-local cache.
- Every graphics/sprite deliverable has its required PNG review artifact.
- The release statement describes measured coverage rather than claiming unsupported completion.

## Family coordination

Use the six selected variants as an explicit comparison matrix and coordinate reusable Generation III methods with Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, and LeafGreen.

Shared parsers, schemas, validation libraries, and cross-target methods should be promoted to [`SakuraiTsubaki/Decompilation`](https://github.com/SakuraiTsubaki/Decompilation) only after they are demonstrated on committed fixtures. This target repository retains its own input identities, target-specific manifests, interpretations, and outputs.

## Status recording

Use one of `planned`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, or `evidence-complete` in future progress records. Record the supporting commit, commands, artifacts, and remaining limitations whenever a status changes. This file intentionally assigns no completion status without that evidence.
